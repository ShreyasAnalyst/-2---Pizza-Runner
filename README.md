<h1><a id="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway‚Ä¶)</p>
<p>Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù</p>
<p>Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!</p>
<p>Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.</p>

<h1><a id="available-data">Available Data</a></h1>
<p>Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business‚Äô growth.</p>
<p>He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.</p>
<p>All datasets exist within the pizza_runner database schema - be sure to include this reference within your SQL scripts as you start exploring the data and answering the case study questions.</p>

    SUM(
        CASE 
            WHEN 
                (LENGTH(exclusions) > 0 AND exclusions <> 'null' AND exclusions IS NOT NULL) OR 
                (LENGTH(extras) > 0 AND extras <> 'null' AND extras IS NOT NULL) = 'true'
            THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END) pizzas_with_changes,
    SUM(
        CASE

<h1><a id="Notes">Notes</a></h1>

- **EXTRACT function:** The EXTRACT function is used to extract specific components (e.g., year, month, day, hour, minute) from a date or timestamp.

- **TO_CHAR function:** The TO_CHAR function in PostgreSQL is used for formatting date and time values into specific string representations. It allows you to convert a date, timestamp, or interval value into a string in a format of your choice.

<h1><a id="insights">Key Insights</a></h1>

1. The total number of pizzas ordered is 14.
2. A total of 8 orders were delivered, and 2 were canceled.
3. The runner with ID 1 has delivered the maximum number of orders, i.e., 4.
4. Non-vegetarian pizzas are in high demand and have been ordered the most.
5. Order No. 4 has the most pizzas, i.e., 3.
6. More than half of customers (3) want pizzas with changes, and the rest (2) want pizzas with no changes.
7. Most pizzas are ordered between 1 PM and 6 PM and 9 PM and 11 PM. That is the afternoon and the late evening.
8. Most customers order on Saturdays and Wednesdays.

<h1><a id="Suggestions">Suggestions</a></h1>

1. The customer with ID 103 ordered the most pizzas (4), so we can give him some kind of VIP pass to encourage him.
2. The customer with ID 105 ordered the least amount of pizzas (1). We can give him discounts or reach out to him to encourage him to purchase more pizzas.
3. We can serve more varieties of non-vegetarian pizzas because they are in high demand.
4. The afternoon and evening are important time zones for us, so we can focus on that time and try to make and deliver pizzas fast. This will have a positive impact on the customer, as they will be happy with the service.
5. On Saturdays and Wednesdays, we can introduce discounts, which will gradually help the sales grow.
